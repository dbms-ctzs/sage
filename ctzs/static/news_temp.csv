Is Air Pollution The Next Pandemic? How Air Quality Increases Deaths From Cardiovascular Disease,"By Gurkiran Dhuga and Glen Pyle

<p>Throughout the last few decades health concerns related to air pollution have been rising. Despite this focus there has been little research on the impact of air pollution on specific health conditions and mortality, even though there is a strong association between air pollution and overall life expectancy. A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32123898/"" target=""_blank"">global study</a> lead by researchers in Germany outlines the detrimental changes air pollution can have on human life expectancy. One surprising finding of the study was that cardiovascular disease, and not respiratory conditions, are the primary cause of early death from air pollution.</p><p>

'Neutrinoless' Double-Beta Decay Gets An Experiment,"A theorized particle process, called neutrinoless double-beta decay, could revise our understanding of ghostly particles called neutrinos, and of their role in the formation of the universe.

But not a single event was detected in CUPID-Mo after one year of data-taking.<br /><br />Isotopes are forms of an element that carry a different number of uncharged particles called neutrons in their atomic nuclei. <br /><p><a href=""https://www.science20.com/news_staff/neutrinoless_doublebeta_decay_gets_an_experiment-249299"" target=""_blank"">read more</a></p>","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 17:05:25 +0000",249299 at https://www.science20.com

That is achieved using magnetic fields inside a ring-shaped vacuum chamber.
